# Analyse-Promotions-and-Provide-Tangible-Insights-to-Sales-Director

🌟 I'm Vishal Dubey, and I recently had the opportunity to dive into an exciting project at AtliQ Mart, the retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in southern India. 🛍️ The challenge? Analyzing the massive Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 promotions across all 50 stores to understand what worked and what didn't. 📊

Tools Used: MySQL for ad-hoc requests, PowerBI for engaging dashboards, Canva for presentation, and Google & ChatGPT for research and planning.

Key Findings:

1️⃣ Mysore Magic: Despite having just 4 stores, Mysore locations ranked in the top 10 by incremental revenue. 🏆

2️⃣ Grocery & Staples Shine: The Grocery & Staples category had the most positive impact post-promotions. 🍲

3️⃣ Winning Promotions: BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) and ₹500 Cashback emerged as the top-performing promotions. 💰

4️⃣ BOGOF Effectiveness: Buy One Get One Free (BOGOF) proved to be the most effective for both sales and revenue. 🎉

Actionable Recommendations:

🔍 In-depth Discussions: Engage with the sales team and store managers across all stores to understand challenges faced during promotional periods.

🚀 New Promo Type: Introduce a new promo type - "Combo Meal Deals" in place of discount promotions.

💡 Pricing Strategy: Avoid offering BOGOF promotions for products priced above ₹500.

🌐 Expansion Plans: Consider opening new stores in Mysore given its exceptional performance.
